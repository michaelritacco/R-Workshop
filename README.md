# R-Workshop

Welcome to my R for Data Science Workshop GitHub repository!

This repository contains all the materials you will need to follow along with the workshop. Inside, you will find a R Workshop Jupyter notebook that contains the code and explanations for each section of the workshop. In addition, a separate Jupyter notebook titled R Workshop Answer Key is provided, which contains the solutions for certain parts of the R workshops. These notebooks are both organized by topic, so you can easily navigate to the section you want to work on.

Additionally, the repository contains a "housing_prices.csv" which is the dataset used in the workshop.

We encourage you to clone or download this repository to your local machine, so you can go through the workshop yourself. To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need to have R installed on your machine, as well as the necessary libraries, such as ggplot.

Throughout the workshop, you will be working on hands-on exercises, so feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches. If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.

I hope you find this repository helpful and enjoy the workshop!
